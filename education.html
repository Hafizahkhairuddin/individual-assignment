    <h4>MY EDUCATION JOURNEY</h4>
    <p>My primary school life begins when I was 7 years old.
     The school is Sekolah Kebangsaan Gelok.
       I pass with flying colors in UPSR in standard 6. 
       Then i went to secondary school, Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan 
        Dato 'Ahmad. I managed to do well in PMR in Form 3 and continued 
        my Form 4 in the same school. Once again I did quite well in SPM
       and I have been offered to enter University Technology Mara 
       at Machang, in 2017. Now, I'm a last year student in
       Diploma in Information Management and I plan to continue 
       my studies to the degree level in 
       Bachelor of Information Science (Hons) Information Systems Management.</p>
